# Alooids-height
Data and R script to analyse the evolution of height across Asphodelaceae subfamily Alooideae (*i.e.*, *Aloe* and related genera) and its consequences on diversification in time and space.

If you intend to run the R script you will need to change all paths in it to the location where you downloaded the 'data' folder.
