# Alooids-height
Data and R script to analyse the evolution of height across Asphodelaceae subfamily Alooideae (*i.e.*, *Aloe* and related genera) and its consequences on diversification in time and space.

This is intended to make the analysis of the following paper reproducible: Boucher, F.C., Quatela, A.-S., Ellis, A.G. & Verboom, G.A. Diversification rate vs. diversification density: decoupled consequences of plant height for diversification of Alooideae in space and time. Plos One, Accepted.

If you intend to run the R script you will need to change all paths in it to the location where you downloaded the 'data' folder.
